    "An 84-year-old man became one of the oldest living kidney donors in the United States in May 2019. The consent process for donor candidates of advanced age relies on data extrapolated from younger cohorts, typically with a median age of 40 years. As the demographic profile of living kidney donors continues to age, gaps in both present and missing data become increasingly evident. This highlights the need to systematically characterize existing data and address these gaps to better inform consent processes and optimize outcomes. Frailty, which is strongly associated with a significantly increased risk of perioperative complications, {cite}`Makary2010`, remains uncaptured in most existing databases. The absence of this critical metric creates additional challenges, particularly in consenting older individuals considering donation.  \n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of older adults (≥50 years) undergoing live donor nephrectomy has quadrupled over the last two decades, a trend expected to persist given demographic shifts, updates in kidney transplant allocation, and changes to Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines. Despite this increase, critical knowledge gaps persist in understanding how older donors cope with the physical stress of nephrectomy, particularly the role of age-related kidney changes (glomerular senescence) and the body’s ability to adapt following a 50% nephron mass loss. Approximately 80% of older donors experience a post-donation GFR <60 ml/min/1.73m², meeting the definition of chronic kidney disease (CKD), placing them at increased risk of frailty and hospitalization as they progress toward CKD. However, no studies have identified clinical signatures of resiliency in this unique population, even as nephrectomy directly impacts their renal system and overall health.\n",
    "\n",
    "This thesis focuses on addressing these gaps by prioritizing the patient’s central question, \"Can I safely donate my kidney?\" over population-level metrics. The scientific aims include: (1) quantifying donation-attributable risks of perioperative death, (2) long-term risks of ESRD and (3) mortality; (4) describing hospitalization prevalence in older donors compared to non-donors; and (4) implementing a risk calculator for perioperative death, long-term ESRD and mortality risks, and sentinel hospitalization in older donors.\n",
    "\n",
    "This thesis will frame its work in the context of various areas of inquiry, including kidney disease, aging research, and data science. The results of all four aims are delivered in an innovative tool—an app—to enhance provider-patient dialogue about kidney donation risks (aim 5). But the architecture of the app offers so much more that will be discussed in the appendix.\n",
    "\n",
    "This thesis addresses the critical need to improve understanding of perioperative and long-term risks for older living kidney donors. By identifying resiliency markers and individualizing risk assessment, the study aims to empower older adults and providers with evidence-based tools to make informed decisions in a growing and vulnerable donor population.\n",

    "## Hospitalization Risks\n",
    "\n",
    "Hospitalization may be a sentinel event signaling risk for adverse outcomes, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and mortality, among living kidney donors (LKDs). However, only two years of follow-up are mandated for LKDs, limiting long-term risk characterization. To address this, we used a XX-year multicenter retrospective cohort study of LKDs with xxx years of follow-up to identify factors associated with patient-reported all-cause hospitalization. \n",
    "\n",
    "Patient factors were captured from self-report and the SRTR. Among an entire cohort of xxxx LKDs, 2,251 donors who donated between May 1968 and December 2019 responded to the survey.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, x (x%) reported any hospitalization a median (interquartile range) of xx (x-x) years post-nephrectomy, with surgery/procedure as the most common cause (57%). The cumulative incidence of hospitalization was 5%, 34%, 50%, and 61% at 1, 10, 15, and 20 years post-donation. In a parsimonious model, age at donation (aHR 1.01–1.13–1.27, p=0.04), female sex (aHR 1.07–1.39–1.80, p=0.01), and post-donation diabetes/hypertension (aHR 1.22–1.52–1.88, p<0.01) were associated with hospitalization. \n",
    "\n",
    "While self-reported, the frequency of hospitalization among LKDs beyond two years post-nephrectomy suggests longer follow-up may be warranted for this population. Furthermore, surveillance and follow-up should be emphasized in populations at higher risk of developing diabetes and hypertension after nephrectomy.\n",

    "_Aim 5: Implement a Calculator for Aims 1 - 4._ This thesis invites exploration of dynamic vs. static presentation of results. Traditional tools summarize average risks, but this app allows exploration of personalized scenarios, offering deeper insights. Users can adjust variables like age, GFR, and comorbidities to visualize personalized risks and uncertainties in real time. This app provides an unprecedented ability to explore personalized risks for donors, facilitating informed decision-making and improving the consent process. The evolving role of technology in medicine is hereby aligned with the importance of open science. The supplemental section of this thesis will address the technical aspects of the app and its potential role in the open science and open source movement.\n",
